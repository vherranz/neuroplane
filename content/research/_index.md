## Research Areas

### Human Brain Development

We investigate neural progenitors arising from the caudal ganglionic eminence and their contribution to cortical and limbic circuitry during human brain development.

### Paralaminar Nucleus of the Amygdala

We study the comparative organization and potential functional relevance of the paralaminar nucleus across mammalian species.

### Immature Neurons and Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Our work explores populations of immature neurons with prolonged maturation and their vulnerability in disorders such as Rett syndrome.
